# Spiking neural network for digit recognition task 
Understanding and modeling a brainâ€™s performance enabled recent advances in Machine Learning. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) with an unsupervised Spike-Timing Dependent plasticity (STDP) rule present the most realistic approximation of neuronal dynamics. In this study, an SNN was investigated on its ability to form memory consolidations in response to ten classes of stimuli - digits of the MNIST dataset. The network consisted of 2500 Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons with conductance-based synapses. Unlike other studies, the model neither received any information on the labels nor used teaching nodes to correct its behavior. However, the results showed no formation of neuronal assemblies in response to different sets of inputs.
